The /Frontend dir contains a Gatsby app to power the FE (in an S3 bucket). Install the Gatsby cli - `npm install -g gatsby-cli`, cd into the Frontend directory, `npm i` and then run `gatsby develop`. Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at localhost:8000. To learn more about Gatsby, checkout their [Quickstart docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/).

The backend can be deployed using [Stackery](https://www.stackery.io/).
